# Music-Library-Management
Enhanced Music Library Management API In this assignment, We will develop a Music Library Management API that allows users within an organization to manage their collection of Artists, Tracks, and Albums. Each organization has a single Admin who oversees the system and its users. The API also provides functionality for users to mark their favorite Artists, Albums, and Tracks for quick access and personalization.

Key Points: One Organization, One Admin: Each organization has a single Admin with full control over the system. Role-Based Access Control: Users have distinct roles (Admin, Editor, Viewer), with permissions tailored to their responsibilities. Entity Relationships: Albums belong to Artists, and Tracks are associated with Albums and Artists. Favorites: Users can personalize their experience by marking items as favorites for easy retrieval
